jstatico
==========================
creates a json tree from a directory, applies the built-in filters and
puts the output in the destination directory.

    npm install jstatico

and then

	jstatico inputDirectory outputDirectory

I use this to generate egeozcan.com

An example site is included. See the folder named "test".
